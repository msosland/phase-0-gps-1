####What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The thing I was struggling with most was just wrapping my head around where I was in the Git workflow. I had to take time to really think about if my remote repo was ahead of my local repo and vise-versa. Merging, pushing, and pulling were definitely the commands I had to think the most about.

####What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Git fetch and merge were clarified during the GPS session for me. I had never used those commands before; I always used -git pull. I know there are benefits to using fetch and merge so it was helpful to get some practice using those commands. I also got more clarification on what could be done through a pull request like tagging and viewing 'diffs'.

####What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about the syntax of merging a branch directly into master without a pull request because I haven't done that much. I usually always create a pull request and merge that way. I couldn't remember if we used -git merge master or -git merge branch-name but I did get clarification on that.

####What still confuses you about git?
I guess the most confusing thing for me right now is thinking about it's use in a larger project when you have multiple people working on the same project. I know it'll be more difficult to keep up with so I'm just trying to think about how the workflow will change once we have many people contributing. I'm still getting used to using -git push and pull but it's getting easier every time I do it.

####How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I had a really good experience and I think everyone worked well together. My pair and I were able to split up the challenge so we were both driving and navigating equally and were able to help eachother out when needed. The collaboration was effective and it was nice to work on a challnge with another person during this remote phase. I'm looking forward to pairing more.
